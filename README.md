This repo contains the source for two packages: [lothlorien](./packages/lothlorien/) and [lothlorien-react](./packages/lothlorien-react/).

-   `lothlorien` is a library for making [tree data structures](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)>).
-   `lothlorien-react` builds on `lothlorien` to provide React UI components to render the data out.

The name is taken from J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the forest that the elves reside in.
